QUICK SETUP - ROLES & PERMISSIONS
========================================

METHOD 1: Using phpMyAdmin (Easiest)
-------------------------------------
1. Open phpMyAdmin in your browser
2. Select your database (e.g., "school_db")
3. Click on the "SQL" tab at the top
4. Click "Choose File" or open the file manually
5. Navigate to: backend/database/roles_permissions.sql
6. Click "Go" to execute
7. Done! All tables and data will be created

METHOD 2: Using MySQL Command Line
-----------------------------------
1. Open Command Prompt/Terminal
2. Navigate to your project folder:
   cd C:\xampp\htdocs\your-project\backend\database
   
3. Run this command:
   mysql -u root -p school_db < roles_permissions.sql
   
   Replace:
   - "root" with your MySQL username
   - "school_db" with your database name
   
4. Enter your MySQL password when prompted
5. Done!

METHOD 3: Using the PHP Setup Script
-------------------------------------
1. Make sure your web server (Apache/XAMPP) is running
2. Open browser and go to:
   http://localhost/backend/database/setup_roles.php
   
   OR if your project is in a subfolder:
   http://localhost/your-project-folder/backend/database/setup_roles.php

3. Follow the on-screen instructions
4. Done!

AFTER SETUP - ASSIGN ROLES TO USERS
====================================
Run these SQL queries to assign roles to your users:

-- Make yourself Super Admin (replace email)
UPDATE users SET role_id = 1 WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Make someone an Admin
UPDATE users SET role_id = 2 WHERE email = 'admin@school.com';

-- Make someone a Teacher
UPDATE users SET role_id = 3 WHERE email = 'teacher@school.com';

ROLE IDs:
---------
1 = Super Administrator
2 = Administrator
3 = Teacher
4 = Accountant
5 = Librarian
6 = Receptionist
7 = Parent
8 = Student

VERIFY SETUP
============
Run this query to check if tables were created:

SHOW TABLES LIKE '%role%';

You should see:
- roles
- role_permissions

Run this to see all roles:

SELECT * FROM roles;

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============
If you get errors:
1. Make sure your database exists
2. Check database credentials in: backend/api/config/database.php
3. Make sure MySQL server is running
4. Try using phpMyAdmin method (most reliable)

NEXT STEPS
==========
After successful setup:
1. Assign roles to your users (see queries above)
2. Go to: backend/admin/roles.html
3. Manage permissions for each role
4. Test with different user accounts
